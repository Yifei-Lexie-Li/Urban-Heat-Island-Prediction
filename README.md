# 🏙️ Urban Heat Island (UHI) Prediction in NYC

## 🌴 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect** in New York City using **machine learning** and **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery** to identify temperature hotspots and key environmental factors.

## 🌲 Dataset
- **Source:** Near-surface air temperature data from **July 24, 2021**.
- **Features:** Geographic coordinates, satellite-derived indices (NDVI, NDBI, B01, B12, etc.), and UHI Index (target variable).

## 🦚 Key Highlights
- **UHI Hotspots Identified**: High-density urban areas exhibit significantly higher temperatures.
- **Vegetation’s Role**: NDVI indicates green spaces contribute to cooling, but built-up areas dominate temperature impact.
- **Satellite Insights**: B01 (Coastal Aerosol) and B12 (Infrared) are top predictors of UHI intensity.
- **Best Model**: XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (**R² = 0.3136**, RMSE = 0.0141).
- **Urban Planning Recommendations**: More green spaces and reflective materials can help reduce UHI effects.
